</details>

<!-- Section: Fees -->
<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>

<h3>Application fees</h3>
<p>In most cases, your fees include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>processing fees for you and anyone included on your application</li>
  <li><a href="#biometrics">biometrics fees</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We ask you to pay at the end of your application.</p>

<h3>Third-party fees</h3>
<p>Depending on your situation, you may also need to pay third parties for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>medical exams</li>
  <li>police certificates</li>
  <li>language testing</li>
  <li>services at a visa application centre, if you use one</li>
</ul>
<p>You pay third-party fees directly to the provider, not through your online account.</p>

<h3 id="payment">Accepted payment methods</h3>
<p>We accept the following payment methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>credit cards and prepaid cards:</strong> Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB</li>
  <li><strong>Visa Debit cards</strong></li>
  <li><strong>debit cards</strong> from a Canadian bank using Interac Online, registered for online banking</li>
</ul>
<p>The card you use does not need to be in your name. The cardholder's name appears on the receipt but does not need to match your application.</p>
<p>If you use a prepaid credit card, keep it for at least 18 months after you pay. This makes refunds easier.</p>

<!-- Section: Biometrics -->
<h2 id="biometrics">Biometrics</h2>

<p>We collect your fingerprints and photo (biometrics) for most applications. If you are between 14 and 79 years old, you probably need to give biometrics.</p>

<p>You only need to give biometrics <strong>once every 10 years</strong>.</p>

<h3>Biometrics fees</h3>
<ul>
  <li>individual applicant: <strong>CAD $85</strong></li>
  <li>families applying at the same time: maximum <strong>CAD $170</strong></li>
  <li>groups of 3 or more performing artists and their staff applying for work permits at the same time: maximum <strong>CAD $255</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Pay the biometrics fee when you submit your application. If you do not, you may experience delays.</p>

<h3>What happens after you apply</h3>
<ol>
  <li>You submit your application and pay fees.</li>
  <li>We send you a letter telling you to give biometrics. You have <strong>30 days</strong> from the date on the letter.</li>
  <li>You go to a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/where-to-give-biometrics.html">collection point</a> to give your fingerprints and photo.</li>
  <li>We start processing your application after we receive your biometrics.</li>
</ol>

<!-- Section: Apply for a minor child -->
<h2 id="minors">Apply for a minor child</h2>

<p>If you are applying for a study permit for a child under 18, there are additional requirements.</p>

<h3>Who applies</h3>
<p>A parent or legal guardian must apply on behalf of a minor child. The parent or guardian signs the application and is the representative.</p>

<h3>Documents you need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a letter of acceptance from the school (if available)</li>
  <li>proof of the parent-child relationship (for example, a birth certificate)</li>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/minor-children-travelling-canada.html">custodianship declaration</a>, if the child will not be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian in Canada</li>
  <li>proof of financial support</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some school boards do not issue a letter of acceptance until the child arrives in Canada. If you cannot get a letter of acceptance before applying, explain this in the <strong>Client information</strong> field of your application.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you already have a study permit</h3>
<p>If you are in Canada with a study permit and want to apply for your dependent children, you can apply from inside Canada. Select "initial study permit" when filling out the application for each child.</p>

<!-- Section: Apply from inside Canada -->
<h2 id="inside">Apply from inside Canada</h2>

<p>Only some people can apply for a study permit from inside Canada. You can apply from inside Canada if you are currently in Canada and one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have a valid study or work permit</li>
  <li>your spouse, common-law partner, or parent has a valid study or work permit</li>
  <li>you are a minor child in primary or secondary school</li>
  <li>you are an exchange student or visiting student</li>
  <li>you completed a short-term course or study program required to be accepted at a DLI</li>
  <li>you or your spouse, common-law partner, or dependent child has a temporary resident permit valid for 6 months or more</li>
  <li>you are being sponsored to immigrate and have already applied for permanent residence</li>
  <li>you or your spouse, common-law partner, or dependent child are subject to an unenforceable removal order</li>
  <li>your spouse, common-law partner, or dependent child is an athlete, media member, member of the clergy, or military personnel on duty in Canada, or is an accredited foreign representative</li>
  <li>you are a refugee claimant in Canada or a family member of a refugee claimant</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of the above applies, you must <a href="#steps">apply from outside Canada</a>.</p>

<h3>If your study permit has expired</h3>
<p>If your study permit has expired and you want to continue studying, you need to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html">restore your status as a student</a>. On the application form, select both "initial study permit or extension of study permit" and "restoration of temporary resident status as a student."</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>Most people in Canada can no longer apply for a study permit at a port of entry. You must apply online for your initial study permit and for any extensions.</p>
</div>

<!-- Section: Apply at a port of entry -->
<h2 id="poe">Apply at a port of entry</h2>

<p>You can apply for a study permit at a Canadian port of entry <strong>only</strong> if you are a:</p>
<ul>
  <li>citizen of the United States</li>
  <li>permanent resident of the United States</li>
  <li>person lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence</li>
  <li>resident of Greenland</li>
  <li>resident of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are eligible, tell the border officer that you want a study permit when you arrive. The officer checks that you meet the requirements and, if eligible, issues the permit. If you are not eligible, the officer refuses the permit, but you may still be able to enter Canada as a visitor.</p>

<!-- Section: Apply on paper -->
<h2 id="paper">Apply on paper</h2>

<p>You can apply on paper <strong>only</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have a disability that prevents you from applying online, or</li>
  <li>you hold an identity or travel document for non-national residents, refugees, or stateless persons</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are eligible to apply on paper, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/apply/paper.html">get the paper application forms and instructions</a>.</p>

Include a letter of explanation stating: "I am a Venezuelan national with a Venezuelan passport, which has been extended for 5 years."</p>
  <p>If your passport is still expired after adding 5 years, it is considered expired. You cannot submit an application with that passport.</p>
