<h2>You can get an electronic travel authorization (eTA)</h2>
<p>Make sure you give yourself time to apply for and get your electronic travel authorization (eTA). We approve most eTAs by email within minutes, but some applications <strong>can take several days</strong> if we ask you to submit supporting documents.</p>
<p><strong>What you need:</strong> electronic travel authorization (eTA) or a valid Canadian visitor visa</p>
<p><strong>Valid for:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Per visit: up to 6 months</li>
    <li>In total: 5 years (or until your passport expires)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> CAN $7</p>
<p><strong>When you need it:</strong> to board your flight to Canada (you don&rsquo;t need it for flights within Canada or to leave Canada)</p>
<p><strong>You also need:</strong> your passport or travel document (valid for your stay in Canada)</p>
<p><strong>If you already have a valid Canadian visitor visa:</strong> you don&rsquo;t need an eTA and can travel with your visa until it expires</p>
<p><strong>If you travel to Canada by car, train, bus or boat instead:</strong> you will need a visitor visa, not an eTA</p>
