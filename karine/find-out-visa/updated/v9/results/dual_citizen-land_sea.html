<h2>You may need a Canadian passport</h2>
<p>Most dual Canadian citizens need a valid Canadian passport to travel to Canada.</p>
<p>This is because, as a Canadian citizen, you’re not eligible for a visitor visa or an electronic travel authorization (eTA).</p>
<p><strong>There are two exceptions to this rule:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>American-Canadian dual citizens with a valid US passport don’t need a Canadian passport. </li>
    <li>Citizens of a country or territory that does not need a visitor visa (they’re visa-exempt) can use a valid passport with that citizenship to travel to Canada by car, train, bus or boat (including cruise ship). </li>
</ol>
